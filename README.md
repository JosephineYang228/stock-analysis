Machine will take less time to run the code and the user could work more effiently to get the result.
### Disadvantages of refactoring:
It's harder for programmers to understand code steps since code has been merged and simplified. More comments are required which takes user more time to read and edit.
### How do these Pros and Cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script:
Pros:Use refactoring to make code readable, and make the code run faster.
Cons:Make comment for each loop and quote URL if we use a code from outside, for instance, official documentation, stack overflow, quora or expert blog posts.
