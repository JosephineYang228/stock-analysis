Module 2 Challenge
## Overview of Project
This project is designed to refactor VBA code of Stock Analysis which we made according to module 2 learning and also measure its performance.
## Results
The refactored code runs faster than the original one, which shows us the necessity to simplify the steps, reduce the used memory and improve the logic. See the instance of Stock Analysis of year 2017:
The original code takes 0.68s to run but the refactor only takes 0.11s.

## Summary
### Advantages of refactoring: 
Machine will take less time to run the code and the user could work more effiently to get the result.
### Disadvantages of refactoring:
It's harder for programmers to understand code steps since code has been merged and simplified. More comments are required which takes user more time to read and edit.
### How do these Pros and Cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script:
Pros:Use refactoring to make code readable, and make the code run faster.
Cons:Make comment for each loop and quote URL if we use a code from outside, for instance, official documentation, stack overflow, quora or expert blog posts.
